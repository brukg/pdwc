# Multi-Object Tracking and Predictive Collision Avoidance for Autonomous Mobile Robots

This repository contains the implementation of a multi-object tracking and predictive collision avoidance system for Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs). The system utilizes lidar sensor data and focuses on Ensemble Kalman Filter and Standard Kalman Filter algorithms for object tracking. The dynamic windowing approach has been modified to improve the performance of the collision avoidance algorithm.

## Features

- Object Detection and Tracking using Ensemble Kalman Filter and Standard Kalman Filter
- Predictive Collision Avoidance based on a modified Dynamic Windowing Approach
- Real-time trajectory planning for safe and efficient navigation
- Integration with ROS2 for simulation and real-world experimentation
